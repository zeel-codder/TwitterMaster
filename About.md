## Which Tech I am Using And Why?
1. Frontend: React js
    React js is the library that builds on Javascript provide by Facebook. Now day react is used by most companies because of its salability and simplicity. So, I am also going to use react js as the frontend in the TwitterMaster app.
2. Backend: Node js
    Node js is One of the most popular for writhing backend nowadays. also, the community is very large. also for my app node js is best as per app need. so I will use node js for my app.
3. Database: MongoDB
    While Creating any full-stack app one of the main think is Database. How you manage a database is one of the key factors for creating the app. MySql and MongoDB both can work for this app. I am going to use MongoDB.
